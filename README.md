# bitcoin-blockchain-clone
my completed bitcoin's blockchain clone project - fully functional and possible to interact through requests
============================================================

Abilities and things i learned while doing this project:

1- Deep understanding of the Javascript language, as it uses Promises, arrow, constructor and destructuring functions; makes personalized .prototype methods and many other new features (ES6, ES7) of the JS language
2- Experience building APIs (Using express)
3- Experience using Postman to test APIs
4- How to use Hash256 for cryptography




Some features of this blockchain are:

- A proof of work algorithm that secures the network.
- Hashing algorithms that secure the data within the blockchain.
- The ability to mine (create) new blocks that contain data.
- The ability to create transactions and store them in blocks.
- An API/server that is used to interact with the blockchain from the internet (Using Express).
- A consensus algorithms to verify that the network nodes have valid data and are synchronized.
- A broadcasting system that keeps the data in the blockchain network synchronized.
